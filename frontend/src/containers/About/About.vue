            <v-card-content>
                When a teacher signs up, they can register students to the site. They can then create courses and assign a group of students to a course. In a course, a teacher can make their own quizzes and tests or they can add any of default quizzes and tests to their course. A teacher will be able to analyse their students performances throughout the course.
